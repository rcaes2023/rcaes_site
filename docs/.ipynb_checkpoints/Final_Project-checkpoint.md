# Final Project

## Part I: Individual Project (20%)
The goal of the final project is to assess your ability to combine and apply the skills you have learned in class in the context of a real-world research problem. Our class has mostly focused on tools for data analysis and visualization, so this must be the focus of your final project. Specifically, we seek to assess your ability to do the following tasks:
•	Discover and download real datasets in standard formats (e.g. CSV, netCDF)
•	Load the data into pandas or xarray, performing any necessary data cleanup (dealing with missing values, proper time encoding, etc.) along the way.
•	Perform realistic scientific calculation involving, for example tasks such as grouping, aggregating, and applying mathematical formulas.
•	Visualize your results in well-formatted plots.

## Part II: Reproducing Another Student’s Project (10%)
The goal of the second part is to assess the reproducibility of the student’s project, and whether the students can reproduce and collaborate with others on code development. Our class focuses on conducting open-source research that are transparent, accessible, reproducible and inclusive, so your final project should demonstrate your understanding and ability to perform open-source research. We seek to assess your ability to:
•	Clearly document your analysis to make it reproducible.  
•	Reproduce the other student’s final project.
•	Bonus points will be given if the students submit pull requests and issues for code development.
